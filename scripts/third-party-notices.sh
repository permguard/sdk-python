# Writes THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md from what the build actually resolves, and checks it is current.
#
# # Why this reads the resolved dependencies rather than the manifest
#
# The manifest says what this project asks for; the resolved set says what a build receives — the
# transitive closure, at the exact versions. A notices file written from the manifest names a
# fraction of what ships, which is worse than no file: it looks like disclosure and is not.
#
# # Why the output is sorted
#
# The file is the input to a CI check that fails when it drifts. That check is only meaningful if a
# regeneration with unchanged dependencies produces byte-identical output, so entries are sorted
# and nothing timestamped or machine-specific is written into it.
#
# # What the reporter reads
#
# `pip-licenses` reports the environment rather than the manifest, so the distribution and its
# dependencies have to be installed before it runs. That is the point: the environment is the
# resolved set, and the manifest is only a request.
